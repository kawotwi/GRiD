Editing the Documentation
=========================

To begin editing the documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   If you haven't already cloned the repository, use the following command to clone the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GRiD.git


2. **Locate the Documentation Files**:
    The Sphinx documentation files are located in the docs/ directory (or a similar name depending on the project setup). 
    Inside this directory, you will find index.rst (the main entry point) and other .rst files that contain the content.

3. **Edit .rst Files**: 
    To edit the documentation, open any .rst file using a text editor (such as VSCode, Atom, or Sublime Text).
    The primary file is index.rst, but other files are organized in subdirectories.

4. **Preview Changes Locally**:
    After making changes you can build locally to preview the changes. See Makefile for instructions for deployment (can use ``make all``)

Building Documentaiton Locally
==============================

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    Before building the documentation, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. 
    You can install the dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Build the Documentation**:
    sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build

3. **View Locally**:
    After building the documentation, you can view it locally by opening the index.html file in your browser.
