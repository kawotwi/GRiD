How to Contribute
=================

We encourage you to contribute in the following ways:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a Branch**: Make sure to create a branch for the work you're doing. For example, if you are adding a new feature, name your branch `feature/feature-name`.
3. **Make Changes**: Implement the changes or additions you would like to contribute. Ensure your code follows the existing code style and structure.
4. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages. Push the changes to your forked repository.
5. **Create a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, create a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into the main repository. Please make sure your PR includes a clear description of the changes, including the reasoning for your modification.

Code of Conduct
===============

We are committed to fostering a welcoming and respectful environment for all contributors. Please be considerate, kind, and respectful in your interactions with others.

We follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), which you can read more about here. If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this code, please contact the project maintainers.

Pull Request Process
====================

1. **Review the Open Issues**: Before creating a pull request, check if there is an open issue for your change. If there isn't, please create an issue describing your change.
2. **Follow the Issue Template**: If you're submitting a bug fix or new feature, please follow the respective issue template to help maintain consistency.
3. **Ensure Your Code Passes Tests**: Ensure your code passes the automated tests before submitting. This includes writing new tests if necessary.
4. **Request Review**: Once your pull request is created, request a review from the maintainers. Be open to feedback and suggestions.
5. **Merge Your Changes**: After approval, the maintainers will merge your pull request into the main codebase. You can merge your changes if you have permission.

Testing and Documentation
=========================

- **Automated Testing**: All contributions must pass our automated tests. This helps ensure that no changes break existing functionality. Please run the tests before submitting your pull request.
- **New Tests**: If your change introduces new functionality, please write tests for your code. Tests should be added in the appropriate test suite.
- **Documentation**: All contributions should include relevant documentation. This includes code comments and updating the project's documentation. Make sure to provide clear explanations for new functions or features.

Code Style
==========

We use the following guidelines for code style:

- **Python Code**:
  - Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
  - Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
  - Avoid using `print()` statements for debugging. Use logging or proper exception handling.
  
- **Commit Messages**:
  - Use clear, concise commit messages.
  - Start the message with a capital letter.
  - Use the present tense ("Fix bug" not "Fixed bug").
  - Include a description of why the change is needed.

- **Docstrings**:
  - Use docstrings to describe all public functions and classes.
  - Follow the [Google Style Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
  
- **Code Formatting**:
  - We use `black` to format Python code. Make sure your changes are formatted using `black` before submitting.
